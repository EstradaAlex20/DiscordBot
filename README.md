# DiscordBot

This is just a very simple and crude discord bot I made just to see what it would take to actually make one. This version has a couple commands like 'die', 'square', and 'bitcoin'. These simulate a die roll, square a number, and fetch the current price of bitcoin.

## Getting Started

If you want to take this bot as a template feel free to do so.

### Prerequisites

Must have:
-python 3+
-discord

### Installing

You are going to need to go to the discord development portal and make a bot. 
Then you need to take the token given to you and put it in the python script at the top of the file.
Then you can just invite your bot to a server and run the python script

## Built With

* [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/) - The website used for fetching bitcoin prices
* [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) - discord api wrapper for python 3+
